# Insurance_Management_Database_Final_Project
## Led a team of 5 scholars to develop a Microsoft Access database using SQL for our mock insurance company over the course of a semester. From the ground up, we drew the relational schema in Visio from our business rules for 15 entities, wrote 5 queries, 5 reports, and 5 forms, loaded our sample data, etc. Grade 134/137.
